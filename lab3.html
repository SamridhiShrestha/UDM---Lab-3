            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Flatiron Coffee was established in 2009 in Boulder, Colorado. Since then, we’ve focused on crafting gourmet specialty coffee with an emphasis on quality.</p>
            <p>Almost all of our products are local and we always strive to create interesting specialties that can’t be found anywhere else.</p>
            <p>No machines to tamp for us or steam our milk or pull our shots. We think the best coffee drinks come from people, not machines.</p>
            <p>We have an extensive collection of food and pastries catering to dietary restrictions and offer many gluten-free and vegan options.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>We support many other local businesses and organizations: Flatiron Coffee has donated to the Colorado Shakespeare Festival, the Boulder Chamber Orchestra, the Boulder Valley School District, Colorado Public Radio, Rocky Mountain Cancer Assistance, the Boulder Homeless Shelter and many more. </p>
            <p>We believe that a strong community creates a place where everyone is welcome and everyone can lay the groundwork for a better future.</p>
            <p>The owner, Melissa, is a Colorado local and graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder. </p>
            <p> She has been hand-crafting specialty espresso drinks for more than two decades and is always looking for new and innovative ways to prepare coffee without ever becoming too pretentious.</p>

                <q><strong>This is one of my new favorite places. The coffee is great, nice and strong. There’s a good amount of space to sit and enjoy your coffee with a nice book. The employees are very nice and pleasant, and the place is relaxing. I love that they are using more recyclable materials (the lid) and I’m definitely going to ask if we can bring in our own reusable mugs as well. So far, great experiences!</strong></q>
